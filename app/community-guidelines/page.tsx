          1. Community Norms
        </h2>

        <h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-3">
          Closer Is for Friendship, Not Dating
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Closer is designed for making friends — not for dating or romantic
          connections. Do not use Closer to pursue romantic or sexual interest
          in other users. This includes using the platform primarily to flirt,
          sending unwanted romantic advances, or any behavior that makes others
          uncomfortable. What happens naturally after a genuine friendship forms
          is between you and that person — but using Closer as a dating app
          undermines the experience for everyone.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-3">
          Be Respectful
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Treat every person you meet on Closer with kindness and respect.
          Everyone on the app is looking to make real connections — approach
          every interaction in good faith. Harassment, bullying, intimidation,
          stalking, threats, and defamation are strictly prohibited, both within
          the app and during in-person meetups.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-3">
          No Hate Speech
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We do not tolerate hate speech or dehumanizing content based on race,
          ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, or
          any other characteristic. This includes derogatory language, slurs, or
          actions that create a hostile environment.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium text-foreground mt-4 mb-3">
          Be Authentic
        </h3>
        <p>
          Be genuine. Your profile should accurately represent who you are. Do
          not create fake profiles, impersonate others, or misrepresent your
          age, identity, or university affiliation. Your profile photo must be
          of you — not someone else, not a celebrity, not a meme.

          5. Meeting In Person
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Closer is built around meeting people face-to-face. When you meet
          someone through the app:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1.5">

              Meet in public spaces only
            </strong>{" "}
            — Closer is designed for campus environments like dining halls,
            libraries, student centers, and quads. Always meet in public,
            populated areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-foreground">
              Leave anytime, no reason needed
            </strong>{" "}
            — you can end any live session or pairing at any time. No
            explanation required. Pressuring someone to stay or continue an
            interaction is a violation of these guidelines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-foreground">Trust your instincts</strong> —
            if something feels off, leave. Your safety comes first.

            <strong className="text-foreground">
              Respect the name confirmation
            </strong>{" "}
            — when you meet someone, introduce yourself honestly with your real
            first name. Giving a fake name violates these guidelines and defeats
            the purpose of Closer&apos;s anti-catfishing system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-foreground">
              Respect boundaries after meeting
            </strong>{" "}
            — becoming friends on Closer does not entitle you to someone&apos;s
            time or attention. If someone doesn&apos;t respond to messages or
            removes you as a friend, respect their decision.

          We reserve the right to take action against any account that violates

          The severity of the action depends on the nature of the violation and
