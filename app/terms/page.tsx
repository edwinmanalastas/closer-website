        <p className="mb-3">
          The Service uses your device&apos;s location to provide core features,
          including displaying your position on the map during live sessions,
          facilitating pairing with nearby users, and sending proximity
          notifications.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          By going live, you consent to your approximate location being visible
          to other nearby users on the map. Location data is only collected
          while you are actively in a live session and is automatically deleted
          when you go offline.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can disable location permissions in your device settings at any
          time, though this will prevent you from using live sessions, pairing,
          and other location-dependent features. For more information about how
          we collect and use location data, please see our{" "}
